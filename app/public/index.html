      <h2>Idea:</h2>
      <p>
        The idea behind this token is to create a contract that can mint NFT
        eggs that can be transferred to the finder's account for no cost. I
        intend to implement this into a static webpage for testing and then
        either a larger dynamic webpage to create some sort of "searching" for
        these eggs and eventually create an extension that will allow the
        creation of these eggs when certain criteria of action are met on any
        webpage. This is a fairly large-scale project and one that I have had in
        mind for a while, I only plan on creating the minting, temp eggs, and
        the static webpage for this project.
      </p>
      <h2>ERC-721:</h2>
      <p>
        EC-721 is currently the base standard for NFTs and allows for the
        creation and tracking of any arbitrarily large number of NFTs. While
        eggs will not be completely unique in their appearance (looking into
        texture mapping) they will be unique in name + serial combination. I may
        add a visual serial to the images as well.
